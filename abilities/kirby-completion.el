;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Sets up the completion backends for Kirbymacs
;; Trying the MOVEC stack (Marginalia, Orderless, Vertico, Embark, Consult) for now
;;

;;; Code:

(use-package vertico
  :init
  (vertico-mode)

  ;; Different scroll margin
  ;; (setq vertico-scroll-margin 0)

  ;; Show more candidates
  ;; (setq vertico-count 20)

  ;; Grow and shrink the Vertico minibuffer
  ;; (setq vertico-resize t)

  ;; Optionally enable cycling for `vertico-next' and `vertico-previous'.
  ;; (setq vertico-cycle t)
  )

;; Persist history over Emacs restarts. Vertico sorts by history position.
(use-package savehist
  :init
  (savehist-mode))

(use-package marginalia
  :hook (vertico-mode . marginalia-mode))

(use-package orderless
  :init
  ;; Configure a custom style dispatcher (see the Consult wiki)
  ;; (setq orderless-style-dispatchers '(+orderless-consult-dispatch orderless-affix-dispatch)
  ;;       orderless-component-separator #'orderless-escapable-split-on-space)
  (setq completion-styles '(orderless basic)
        completion-category-defaults nil
        completion-category-overrides '((file (styles partial-completion)))))

(provide 'kirby-completion)
